    Perform the reparameterization trick to sample from a distribution with the given mean and std
    Inputs:
        mean - Tensor of arbitrary shape and range, denoting the mean of the distributions
        std - Tensor of arbitrary shape with strictly positive values. Denotes the standard deviation
              of the distribution
    Outputs:
        z - A sample of the distributions, with gradient support for both mean and std. 
            The tensor should have the same shape as the mean and std input tensors.

    Calculates the Kullback-Leibler divergence of given distributions to unit Gaussians over the last dimension.
    See Section 1.3 for the formula.
    Inputs:
        mean - Tensor of arbitrary shape and range, denoting the mean of the distributions.
        log_std - Tensor of arbitrary shape and range, denoting the log standard deviation of the distributions.
    Outputs:
        KLD - Tensor with one less dimension than mean and log_std (summed over last dimension).

    Visualize a manifold over a 2 dimensional latent space. The images in the manifold
    should represent the decoder's output means (not binarized samples of those).
    Inputs:
        decoder - Decoder model such as LinearDecoder or ConvolutionalDecoder.
        grid_size - Number of steps/images to have per axis in the manifold.
                    Overall you need to generate grid_size**2 images, and the distance
                    between different latents in percentiles is 1/(grid_size+1)

    ## Hints:
    # - You can use scipy's function "norm.ppf" to obtain z values at percentiles.
    # - Use the range [0.5/(grid_size+1), 1.5/(grid_size+1), ..., (grid_size+0.5)/(grid_size+1)] for the percentiles.
    # - torch.meshgrid might be helpful for creating the grid of values
    # - You can use torchvision's function "make_grid" to combine the grid_size**2 images into a grid
    # - Remember to apply a sigmoid after the decoder
